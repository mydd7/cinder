Installers are built by GitHub Actions. Windows installers are unsigned. macOS apps are ad-hoc signed and are not notarized.

On macOS, copy Cinder to Applications. If Gatekeeper blocks it, you can remove the download quarantine after checking the release's SHA-256 checksum:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Cinder.app
```

## Features

- Usage by tool, model, project and session, with hourly charts for Today.
- Costs, cache usage, speed premiums and custom model prices.
- Account quotas, reset times and available reset credits.
- Tool calls, MCP servers, skills and CSV exports.
- Fifteen themes with light, dark and system modes.

Cinder reads saved history from 19 tools, including Claude, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode and Grok. See [supported sources](docs/sources.md) for the full list.

History stays on your computer. Opening Limits or loading Cursor billing data contacts the provider using its existing login. Cost estimates are separate from subscription invoices.
